- Each marker represents a bloom report location and is clickable.
- Clicking a marker triggers a callback with the selected report.
- Markers visually indicate selection and report intensity.
- The map includes a heatmap layer to visualize bloom intensity.
- Marker popups show user info, description, image count, and likes.
- The component receives reports, a selection callback, and the selected report as props.
- The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles for its base layer.
