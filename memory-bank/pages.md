- Main pages are located in `src/pages/`.
- `Index.tsx` is the main entry page of the app.
- `NotFound.tsx` handles 404 or unknown routes.
- Pages define the main navigation and routing structure.
- `Index.tsx` manages the sidebar open state, mode (`'location'` or `'info'`), and data fetching for both location and info drawer modes. It coordinates when the sidebar opens and what content is shown, and passes all relevant props to Sidebar and MapHeader.
