- Main UI components are located in `src/components/`.
- `Sidebar.tsx` provides navigation or filtering options for the app.
- `Header.tsx` displays the app title or navigation bar.
- `ImageGallery.tsx` displays images related to bloom reports.
- Components are designed for modularity and reuse in the UI.
- `Sidebar.tsx` now receives its open state, mode (`'location'` or `'info'`), and data as props from the main page. It displays either location details (including flowers and reports) or info content, depending on mode.
- The sidebar opens immediately when a location is clicked, and shows a loading spinner for flowers until the data is loaded.
- `FlowersList.tsx` receives its data and loading state as props, and no longer fetches data internally.
- The reports section in the sidebar shows a loading spinner if reports are loading (placeholder for now).
- `MapHeader.tsx` receives an `onInfoClick` prop, which opens the sidebar in info mode when triggered.
- The sidebar content resets to default only after the close animation completes (300ms delay).
