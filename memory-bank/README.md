This folder contains concise, atomic markdown summaries of the main domains and modules in the codebase. Each file covers a specific domain or area, with facts listed as bullet points for easy reference by agents and developers.

- Each file is named after a domain or module (e.g., `map.md`, `services.md`).
- Each fact starts with a dash and is on its own line.
- Facts are concise, atomic, and up-to-date.
- Update these files incrementally as the codebase evolves.
